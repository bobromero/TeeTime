<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is a Mod that requires Melon Loader and of course Slapshot Rebound. Download instructions can be found on the <a href = "https://www.nexusmods.com/slapshotrebound/mods/3">Nexusmods</a>. page and the <a href = "https://discord.gg/t4XDkAKpTr">Discord</a>.

### Prerequisites

All instructions can be found on the discord, but you will need .net 6 or later to use the mod.

### Instructions

The steps to make a pack are as follows,
1. Set up a scene by setting spawns with C for player spawn F for puck Spawn and G for puck call location.
2. Once you are happy with a scene, press f1 and click save as scene.
   It is now saved and you can reset the ice and set up a new scene.
3. Once you are happy with your scenes, you can press save as pack, and it will prompt you with a text box.
4. Type the name of your pack, normal file naming conventions, and click save as pack again.

The pack is created and now in your slapshot folder, you will see a new folder called Training packs, and the pack will be in there.

You can share this file with others who have the mod, and they can play the scenes you set up.

Putting packs in your training pack folder will allow you to load them in game.
